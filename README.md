This example demonstrates a common issue with mutable variables in F# functions.  The `add` function doesn't capture the initial values of `x` and `y`. Instead, it uses the current values of `x` and `y` in the scope where `add` is called. This can lead to unexpected results when the mutable variables are modified after the function is defined but before it's called. The solution shows how to properly use immutability or pass arguments explicitly to avoid the issue.
